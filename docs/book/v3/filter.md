# Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter

Hydrator filters allow you to manipulate the behavior of the `extract()`
operation.  This is especially useful, if you want to omit some internals (e.g.
`getServiceManager()`) from the array representation.

It comes with a helpful `Composite` implementation, and several filters for
common use cases. The filters are composed in the `AbstractHydrator`, so you can
start using them immediately in any custom extensions you write that extend that
class.

```php
namespace Laminas\Hydrator\Filter;

interface FilterInterface
{
    /**
     * Should return true, if the given filter does not match.
     */
    public function filter(string $property) : bool;
}
```

If it returns true, the key/value pairs will be in the extracted arrays - if it
returns false, you'll not see them again.

## Filter implementations

### Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter\\GetFilter

This filter is used in the `ClassMethodsHydrator` to decide which getters will
be extracted. It checks if the key to extract starts with `get` or the object
contains a method beginning with `get` (e.g., `Laminas\Foo\Bar::getFoo`).

### Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter\\HasFilter

This filter is used in the `ClassMethodsHydrator` to decide which `has` methods
will be extracted. It checks if the key to extract begins with `has` or the
object contains a method beginning with `has` (e.g., `Laminas\Foo\Bar::hasFoo`).

### Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter\\IsFilter

This filter is used in the `ClassMethodsHydrator` to decide which `is` methods
will be extracted. It checks if the key to extract begins with `is` or the
object contains a method beginning with `is` (e.g., `Laminas\Foo\Bar::isFoo`).

### Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter\\MethodMatchFilter

This filter allows you to omit methods during extraction that match the
condition defined in the composite.  The name of the method is specified in the
constructor of this filter; the second parameter decides whether to use white or
blacklisting to decide (whitelisting retains only the matching method, blacklist
omits any matching method). The default is blacklisting - pass `false` to change
the behavior.

### Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter\\NumberOfParameterFilter

This filter is used in the `ClassMethodsHydrator` to check the number of
parameters. By convention, the `get`, `has` and `is` methods do not get any
parameters - but it may happen. You can add your own number of required
parameters, simply add the number to the constructor. The default value is 0. If
the method has more or fewer parameters than what the filter accepts, it will be
omitted.

## Use FilterComposite for complex filters

`FilterComposite` implements `FilterInterface` as well, so you can add it as a
regular filter to the hydrator. One benefit of this implementation is that you
can add the filters with a condition and accomplish complex requirements using
different filters with different conditions. You can pass the following
conditions to the 3rd parameter, when you add a filter:

### Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter\\FilterComposite::CONDITION\_OR

At the given level of the composite, at least one filter set using
`CONDITION_OR` must return true to extract the value.

### Laminas\\Hydrator\\Filter\\FilterComposite::CONDITION\_AND

At the given level of the composite, **all** filters set using `CONDITION_AND`
must return true to extract the value.

### FilterComposite Examples

To illustrate how conditions apply when composing filters, consider the
following set of filters:

```php
$composite = new FilterComposite();

$composite->addFilter('one', $condition1);
$composite->addFilter('two', $condition2);
$composite->addFilter('three', $condition3);
$composite->addFilter('four', $condition4, FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND);
$composite->addFilter('five', $condition5, FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND);
```

The above is roughly equivalent to the following conditional:

```php
// This is what's happening internally
if (
     ($condition1
        || $condition2
        || $condition3
     ) && ($condition4
        && $condition5
     )
) {
    // do extraction
}
```

If you only have one condition block (e.g., only `AND` or `OR` filters), the
other condition type will be completely ignored.

A bit more complex filter can look like this:

```php
$composite = new FilterComposite();
$composite->addFilter(
    'servicemanager',
    new MethodMatchFilter('getServiceManager'),
    FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND
);
$composite->addFilter(
    'eventmanager',
    new MethodMatchFilter('getEventManager'),
    FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND
);

$hydrator->addFilter('excludes', $composite, FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND);

// Internal
if (( // default composite inside the ClassMethodsHydrator:
        ($getFilter
            || $hasFilter
            || $isFilter
        ) && (
            $numberOfParameterFilter
        )
   ) && ( // new composite, added to the one above
        $serviceManagerFilter
        && $eventManagerFilter
   )
) {
    // do extraction
}
```

If you perform this on the `ClassMethodsHydrator`, all getters will get
extracted, except for `getServiceManager()` and `getEventManager()`.

## Using the provider interface

`Laminas\Hydrator\Filter\FilterProviderInterface` allows you to configure the
behavior of the hydrator inside your objects.

```php
namespace Laminas\Hydrator\Filter;

interface FilterProviderInterface
{
    /**
     * Provides a filter for hydration
     *
     * @return FilterInterface
     */
    public function getFilter();
}
```

(The `getFilter()` method is automatically excluded from `extract()`.) If the
extracted object implements the `Laminas\Hydrator\Filter\FilterProviderInterface`,
the returned `FilterInterface` instance can also be a `FilterComposite`.

For example:

```php
Class Foo implements FilterProviderInterface
{
     public function getFoo()
     {
         return 'foo';
     }

     public function hasFoo()
     {
         return true;
     }

     public function getServiceManager()
     {
         return 'servicemanager';
     }

     public function getEventManager()
     {
         return 'eventmanager';
     }

     public function getFilter()
     {
         $composite = new FilterComposite();
         $composite->addFilter('get', new GetFilter());

         $exclusionComposite = new FilterComposite();
         $exclusionComposite->addFilter(
             'servicemanager',
             new MethodMatchFilter('getServiceManager'),
             FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND
             );
         $exclusionComposite->addFilter(
             'eventmanager',
             new MethodMatchFilter('getEventManager'),
             FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND
         );

         $composite->addFilter('excludes', $exclusionComposite, FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND);

         return $composite;
     }
}

$hydrator = new ClassMethodsHydrator(false);
$extractedArray = $hydrator->extract(new Foo());
```

`$extractedArray` will only have 'foo' =&gt; 'foo'; all other values are
excluded from extraction.

## Filter-enabled hydrators and the composite filter

Hydrators can indicate they are filter-enabled by implementing
`Laminas\Hydrator\Filter\FilterEnabledInterface`:

```php
namespace Laminas\Hydrator\Filter;

interface FilterEnabledInterface extends FilterProviderInterface
{
    /**
     * Add a new filter to take care of what needs to be hydrated.
     * To exclude e.g. the method getServiceLocator:
     *
     * <code>
     * $composite->addFilter(
     *     "servicelocator",
     *     function ($property) {
     *         [$class, $method] = explode('::', $property, 2);
     *         return $method !== 'getServiceLocator';
     *     },
     *     FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND
     * );
     * </code>
     *
     * @param string $name Index in the composite
     * @param callable|FilterInterface $filter
     */
    public function addFilter(string $name, $filter, int $condition = FilterComposite::CONDITION_OR) : void;

    /**
     * Check whether a specific filter exists at key $name or not
     *
     * @param string $name Index in the composite
     */
    public function hasFilter(string $name) : bool;

    /**
     * Remove a filter from the composition.
     *
     * To not extract "has" methods, you simply need to unregister it
     *
     * <code>
     * $filterComposite->removeFilter('has');
     * </code>
     */
    public function removeFilter(string $name) : void;
}
```

> Note that the interface extends `FilterProviderInterface`, which means it also
> includes the `getFilter()` method.

The `FilterEnabledInterface` makes the assumption that the class will be backed
by a `Laminas\Hydrator\Filter\FilterComposite`; the various `addFilter()`,
`hasFilter()`, and `removeFilter()` methods are expected to proxy to a
`FilterComposite` instance.

`AbstractHydrator`, on which all the hydrators shipped in this package are
built, implements `FilterEnabledInterface`. Of the hydrators shipped, only one,
`ClassMethodsHydrator`, defines any filters from the outset. Its constructor
includes the following:

```php
$this->filterComposite->addFilter('is', new IsFilter());
$this->filterComposite->addFilter('has', new HasFilter());
$this->filterComposite->addFilter('get', new GetFilter());
$this->filterComposite->addFilter(
    'parameter',
    new NumberOfParameterFilter(),
    FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND
);
```

### Remove filters

If you want to tell a filter-enabled hydrator such as `ClassMethodsHydrator` not
to extract methods that start with `is`, remove the related filter:

```php
$hydrator = new ClassMethodsHydrator(false);
$hydrator->removeFilter('is');
```

After performing the above, the key/value pairs for `is` methods will no longer
end up in your extracted array.

### Add filters

You can add filters using the `addFilter()` method. Filters can either implement
`FilterInterface`, or simply be PHP callables:

```php
$hydrator->addFilter('len', function($property) {
    return strlen($property) === 3;
});
```

By default, every filter you add will be added with a conditional `OR`. If you
want to add it with `AND` (such as the `ClassMethodsHydrator` does with its
composed `NumberOfParameterFilter`, demonstrated above) provide the conditon as
the third argument to `addFilter`:

```php
$hydrator->addFilter('len', function($property) {
    return strlen($property) === 3;
}, FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND);
```

One common use case for filters is to omit getters for values that you do not
want to represent, such as a service manager instance:

```php
$hydrator->addFilter(
    'servicemanager',
    new MethodMatchFilter('getServiceManager'),
    FilterComposite::CONDITION_AND
);
```

The example above will exclude the `getServiceManager()` method and the
`servicemanager` key from extraction, even if the `get` filter wants to add it.
